> The solution tries to eradicate the issues existing with current
> nation-level digital
>
> farm-management portals such as, but not limited to, 'AMU-AMR
> Livestock Tool by NIVEDI'. Currently, portals as these do mitigate
> issues, but not robustly. There are areas of further improvement such
> as in adopting mobile implementations, enhancing farmer-centric
>
> user-experience, elevating current data-visualizations, adopting
> offline solutions, and adoption of AI-based guidance. Our solution
> would consist of a web-based platform (front-end and
>
> back-end), and also a mobile-application (flutter-based). Our solution
> includes all of these. The gaps in these particular areas have been
> researched and found out to be significantly relevant. The modules in
> the system shall be: Livestock Records Management, Feed and Nutrition

Tracking, Health & Vaccination Management, Yield Records,
AMU-Monitoring, and AMR-Monitoring.

The solution would have a spectrum of outcomes as a follow-up: increase
in usage of digital livestock-services by farmers, fastening
implementation of gov. policies in relation with the Department of
Animal Husbandry & Dairying (DoAH&D), and increase in the quality of
service (QoS) in the digital-farming domain.
